# Directory Structure

This repository contains the source code associated with our paper. The key directories are structured as follows:

## src/

This directory contains the source code for our tool.

## src/frontend

This directory contains the frontend of this project, which transfer the ark byte code to intermediate representation.

## src/engine

This directory conducts the static analysis , generates semantic results for the taint analysis. 

## src/engine/src/taint

This directory base on the result generated by the static analysis engine, runs taint analysis to find potential private information leakage.

## Dependencies

-Python 3.12

-Linux 

All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. Install them using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run this tool

The analysis script is `scripts/analyzer.sh`.

Run this script under the `hscope-main` directory for testing. Example:
```
scripts/analyzer.sh --default-settings ./rules path/of/abc.txt
```

The result is in test/analyzer_workspace/submodule1_workspace/analysis_log.txt, in which the analysis result is represented, if this tool finds a potential leakage from source to sink it will print a "sink in". If this tool finds a source, it will print "taint here".
